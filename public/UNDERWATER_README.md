Place a short, muted looping MP4 named `underwater.mp4` in this `public/` folder to enable the login background video.

Recommended properties:
- Format: MP4 (H.264)
- Resolution: 1280x720 or 1920x1080
- Length: 6-20s (loopable)
- Muted: required for autoplay in browsers
- Optional: add `underwater-poster.jpg` to use as a fallback poster image

After adding the file, start the frontend dev server and open the login page. The video will be served at `/underwater.mp4`.
